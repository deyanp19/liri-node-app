# liri-node-app
search assistant
// The purpose of this app is to create a searchable capability by connecting to twitter, spotify and OMDB
// I will create NodeJS environment wihich will get all the dynamic requests

// 1. I created an environment by installing the pakcages and initializing the node 
// 2. I installed different packages needed to the envirinment- require, tweeter, spotify
//3. Created .gitignore files so the whole environment of node is not uploaded to github
//4. Created variables in which the keys to call the tweeter and spotify API are stored
//5. Created .evo file wiich holds the keys itself so they are not vidsible to everybody who visits the site
